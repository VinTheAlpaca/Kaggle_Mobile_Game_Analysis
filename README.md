# Kaggle_Mobile_Game_Analysis

### Project Description

The project is based on R. It was aimming to make a detailed exploration and analysis of the data of mobile games on kaggle, and use the supervised learning model to make a predictive analysis of the scores, evaluation quantity and success of these mobile games.

### Project Responsibilities

My responsibilities in the project include,

1. Using feature engineering, including (feature cleaning, PCA dimension reduction, one hot coding, chi square test, etc.) for data processing.
2. Applying regression neural network model to analyze and predict the number of downloads, reviews and user ratings of mobile games.
3. Optimize Regression neural network model (including cross validation, parameter adjustment and resampling).

### Project achievements

1. We have successfully built an RNN model that can predict the success of mobile games by analyzing the classification, online time, development team and other elements.
2. The SSE of the RNN model is 1.2692.
3. We found several important factors influencing the success of IOS mobile games, such as development team and classification.
